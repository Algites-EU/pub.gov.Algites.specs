## 🎯 Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to:

- provide a single source of truth for Algites-wide standards,
- ensure consistency across repositories and artifacts,
- enable long-term maintainability and governance of the ecosystem,
- make all core conventions publicly visible and reviewable.

The documents here are **normative** unless explicitly stated otherwise.

## 📚 Scope

This repository may include specifications such as:

- repository and artifact naming standards,
- CI/CD and build governance rules,
- architectural guidelines,
- security and compliance policies,
- versioning and release conventions,
- interoperability and integration rules.

## 🗂 Repository Structure

The repository is organized by topics. A typical structure looks like:

```
/
├── naming/
│   └── Algites-Repository-And-Artifact-Naming-Standard.md

Each top-level folder represents one governance domain and may contain one or more
normative specification documents.

## 📄 Key Documents

- **Algites Repository and Artifact Naming Standard**
  Defines the canonical naming rules for repositories, groupIds, artifactIds,
  variants, and visibility across the Algites ecosystem.

Additional specifications will be added over time.

## 🏷 Versioning

Each specification document maintains its own version (e.g., v1.5) within the document itself.

Changes to specifications should:

- increment the document version,
- be documented in a change log section if present,
- preserve backward compatibility where possible, or clearly state breaking changes.
